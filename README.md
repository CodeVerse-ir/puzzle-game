# Puzzle Game  

Welcome to the Puzzle Game! This is an interactive puzzle game that allows players to rearrange tiles to their correct positions.  

## Features  

- **Customizable Grid Size**: Define the number of rows and columns of the puzzle using the `size` parameter.  
- **Shuffle Control**: Adjust the level of shuffling using the `shuffle` parameter to determine how mixed up the puzzle tiles are.  
- **Manual and Automatic Solutions**: Solve the puzzle manually by dragging and dropping the tiles or let the game automatically solve it using advanced algorithms:  
  - **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
  - **Bidirectional Search (BDS)**  
  - **A\* Algorithm**  
- **Debugging Information**: Access detailed debugging information in the browser console while playing.  

## How to Play  

1. Set the desired `size` for your puzzle and the `shuffle` level to see how mixed up the tiles will be.  
2. You can rearrange the tiles manually by clicking and dragging them into their correct positions, or you can choose to let the game solve it for you.  
3. Open the browser console to view additional information and debugging data about the puzzle state and the algorithm process.
